# Fingertip Tactile Actuator ROI Edge Detection Simulator
 This was created for a 4x4 Fingertip sensor research paper that was accepted into the IEEE 2020 Sensors conference. The full research paper can be found [here](https://hira.hope.ac.uk/id/eprint/3151/).
## Setup
* pip install opencv-python
* Run main.py and it works!
 ## To Do
 * Optimize Sensitivity Threshold
 * Optimize how pixel groups are checked for actuation
 * Optimize how pixel groups are drawn
